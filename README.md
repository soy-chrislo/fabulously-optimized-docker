# Fabulously Optimized Docker Workflow

- Docker image available in my Docker Hub repo: [Fabulously Optimized Docker Image](https://github.com/soy-chrislo/fabulously-optimized-docker)

New verions are saved in each folder, saves from providers, the files that are not contained in `persist.md` and run `Dockerfile`.

The only bind mount is `world`, so keep `runDocker.sh` and run it in your local/server environment.
